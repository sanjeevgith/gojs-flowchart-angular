# gojs-angular-basic

### By Northwoods Software for [GoJS](https://gojs.net)

This project provides a basic example of using GoJS in an Angular app.
Check out the [Intro page on using GoJS with Angular](https://gojs.net/latest/intro/angular.html) for more information.

It makes use of the [gojs-angular](https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-angular) package to handle setting up Diagram, Palette and Overview components.

When running the sample, try moving / adding / deleting nodes, editing text in the inspector, relinking nodes via ports, undoing (Ctrl-Z), and re-doing (Ctrl-Y) within the diagram. You'll notice the changes are reflected in app-level data. You'll also notice that changes
made in the inspector are reflected in the diagram.
